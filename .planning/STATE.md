# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Voice Reliability

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 5 (Voice Reliability)
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase
Status: Plans 03-01 and 03-02 complete — continuing phase 03
Last activity: 2026-03-01 — Completed plan 03-01 (TURN provider abstraction)

Progress: [████████░░] 60%

## Performance Metrics

- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 1.9 minutes
- Total execution time: 0.13 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Bundled TURN server (coturn) — Self-hosters shouldn't need external TURN service
- Feature toggles via server config — Server owners control features without code changes
- Type-ahead popup for @mentions — Good UX without full Discord-style mention chips
- Dropdown renders above input (not below) for better visibility (01-01)
- Max 5 items visible before scrolling in autocomplete (01-01)
- ARIA attributes added for screen reader accessibility (01-01)
- Tab key selects mention (Discord/Slack behavior) (01-02)
- Stable input ID prevents Hook event listener breakage (01-02)
- Input re-acquisition in updated() handles LiveView DOM replacements (01-02)
- User-specific PubSub topic subscription for desktop notifications (02-01)
- Client-side notification suppression when viewing mentioned channel (02-01)
- Notification sound preloading with audio node cloning for overlapping playback (02-01)
- Permission request on first notification attempt, not on page load (02-01)
- @behaviour pattern for swappable TURN providers (Coturn/Metered) via TURN_PROVIDER env var (03-01)
- Use :crypto.mac/4 not deprecated :crypto.hmac/3 which was removed in OTP 26 (03-01)
- TURN env vars read at runtime in provider modules, not at boot — server starts STUN-only without config (03-01)
- network_mode: host used on Linux to avoid Docker NAT breaking TURN relay (03-02)
- Relay port range kept narrow for local dev (49152-49200); Dockerfile.coturn EXPOSE covers full range for production (03-02)
- TURN_SECRET env var substitution is native Coturn feature — no shell scripting needed (03-02)
